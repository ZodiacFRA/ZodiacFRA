## Personal Website
---------
I need:
## I) Main aggregation pages
To show all the projects:
- The projects in index.json will be put on the front page (~best projects selection)
- All the projects in other json files will put in the "Other works" page

In the main aggregation pages I need to be able to display:
- single pictures (most of the time it's for projects having their own page or really short projects)
- Slide shows (for projects which do not need their own page but have multiple renders)
- Videos

## II) Themed aggregation pages
To show all the projects per theme (3D / Code) which are specified in the JSONs  
- Their display works like for the "Main aggregation pages"  
- Only difference is that the projects are sorted by date (most recent first)

## III) Single project pages
Made to showcase a single project, but I want to be able to:
- Define a specific html for the html body to suit each project
