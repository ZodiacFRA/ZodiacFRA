    My 3D python implementation of the
    <a href='github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse'>Wave Function Collapse</a> (WFC) algorithm<br>
    The addition of a 3rd dimension took me a bit of time, but the integration into Blender was quite fast
    as I already used multiple times Blender's Python API
    <br><br>
    Source code available <a href='https://github.com/ZodiacFRA/Blender_WaveFunctionCollapse'>here</a>

        All renders are made using Eevee, with a set of 17 modules
        <br><br>
        I also create all rotated versions of those 17 modules, resulting in 362 modules
